## FSM benefits

- Make a good refactor target
- Great for visually modelling your logic
- Prevents Impossible states
- Easier to debug and reason about
- Separates UI from business logic
- Even the
  [redux style guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide/#treat-reducers-as-state-machines)
  advises us to treat reducers as state machines
