# Xstate

You can roll your own little state machines, but often it is not sufficient when
managing state at scale.

Xstate even provides some features that FSMs do not, for example:

- Nested states - helps in grouping behaviour
- Parallel states - helps in defining behaviours that can occur simultaneously
- State actions - helps in defining actions that should be performed when we
  enter/exit a particular state
- Guarded Transitions - very important for conditionally taking transitions
  based on more than just the state and event type
- Extended state - the state that lives besides the state machine.

Let's code the geolocation app from earlier in xstate.

The initial state of the machine is `idle`. We have the states `pending`,
`resolved`, `rejected` from before. We have now added a new state of
`rejectedNotSupported` for the case when device not support geolocation and that
is different from `rejected`.

```javascript
const geoPositionMachine = Machine({
  id: 'geoposition',
  initial: 'idle',
  states: {
    idle: {},
    pending: {},
    resolved: {},
    rejected: {},
    rejectedNotSupported: {},
  },
})
```

Now we can define some events on the states. We haven't defined any events on
the `rejectedNotSupported` since it is a terminal state

```javascript
const geoPositionMachine = Machine({
  id: 'geoposition',
  initial: 'idle',
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: {
        START: 'pending',
        REJECT_NOT_SUPPPORTED: 'rejectNotSupported',
      },
    },
    pending: {
      on: {
        RESOLVE: 'resolved',
        REJECT: 'rejected',
      },
    },
    resolved: {
      on: {
        RESOLVE: 'resolved',
        REJECT: 'rejected',
      },
    },
    rejected: {
      on: {
        RESOLVE: 'resolved',
        REJECT: 'rejected',
      },
    },
    rejectedNotSupported: {},
  },
})
```

We have now successfully defined a state machine, but with Xstate we can do
more. We can define extended state and actions to perform when we enter or leave
a state.

We can define an extended state by using the `context` property. This context
can be accessed anywhere by all the states.

```javascript
const geoPositionMachine = Machine({
  id: 'geoposition',
  initial: 'idle',
  context: {
    position: null,
    error: null
  },
  states: {
    // ...
  }
```

Actions are like side effect of which there are 3 kinds:

1. `entry` actions that execute upon entering a state.
2. `exit` actions that execute upon exiting a state.
3. `transition` actions that execute when a transition is taken

These are represented in the state machine definition as:

```javascript
const triggerMachine = Machine(
  {
    id: 'trigger',
    initial: 'inactive',
    states: {
      inactive: {
        on: {
          TRIGGER: {
            target: 'active',
            // transition actions
            actions: ['activate', 'sendTelemetry'],
          },
        },
      },
      active: {
        // entry actions
        entry: ['notifyActive', 'sendTelemetry'],
        // exit actions
        exit: ['notifyInactive', 'sendTelemetry'],
        on: {
          STOP: 'inactive',
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      // action implementations
      activate: (context, event) => {
        console.log('activating...')
      },
      notifyActive: (context, event) => {
        console.log('active!')
      },
      notifyInactive: (context, event) => {
        console.log('inactive!')
      },
      sendTelemetry: (context, event) => {
        console.log('time:', Date.now())
      },
    },
  },
)
```

You might say what is the difference between `transition` action and
`entry/exit` transition. Well, `entry/exit` actions mean "execute this action
**on any transition that enters/exit this state**". Whereas `transition` actions
mean "execute this action **only on this transition**"

So for our geoposition machines we want to trigger a `setPosition` action
whenever the `RESOLVE` event takes place and a `setError` action whenever the
`REJECT` event takes place.

We can use the `assign` action that Xstate provides to update the machine's
context.

```
actions: {
  setPosition: assign({
    position: (context, event) => event.position,
  }),
  setError: assign({
    error: (context, event) => event.error,
  }),
}
```

We also need to specify the actions on the event object. Here's what the entire
machine looks like:

```javascript
const RESOLVE = {
  target: 'resolved',
  actions: 'setPosition',
}

const REJECT = {
  target: 'rejected',
  actions: 'setError',
}

const geoPositionMachine = Machine(
  {
    id: 'geoposition',
    initial: 'idle',
    context: {
      position: null,
      error: null,
    },
    states: {
      idle: {
        on: {
          START: 'pending',
          REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED: 'rejectedNotSupported',
        },
      },
      pending: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      resolved: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      rejected: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      rejectedNotSupported: {},
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      setPosition: assign({
        position: (context, event) => event.position,
      }),
      setError: assign({
        error: (context, event) => event.error,
      }),
    },
  },
)
```

The tough part is done, now let's see how we would use this machine in React.

Xstate provides us a `useMachine` hook that we can use. It takes in a machine as
an argument and sends back the state and the send function. This API might seem
familiar if you know about `useReducer` where we give it a initial state and the
reducer and get back the state and the dispatch function.

```javascript
const [state, send] = useMachine(geoPositionMachine)
```

Using the `send` function we can dispatch events by sending in the event type.

```javascript
send('REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED')

// or

send({type: 'REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED'})
```

We can also include any data with the event which will be available to the
action using the `event` object.

```javascript
send({type: 'RESOLVE', position: position})
```

We can now create a `useGeoPosition` hook that will encapsulate all the logic
related to handling the geoposition API.

```javascript
function useGeoPosition() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(geoPositionMachine)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
      send('REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED')
      return
    }

    send('START')

    const geoWatch = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
      position => send({type: 'RESOLVE', position}),
      error => send({type: 'REJECT', error}),
    )
    return () => navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(geoWatch)
  }, [send])

  return state
}
```

You can now use this hook to build your UI

```jsx
function App() {
  const state = useGeoPosition()

  // the state of the state machine
  const status = state.value

  const {position, error} = state.context

  if (status === 'rejectedNotSupported') {
    return <div>This browser does not support Geolocation</div>
  }

  if (status === 'idle' || status === 'pending') {
    return <div>Loading your position...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'resolved') {
    return (
      <div>
        Lat: {position.coords.latitude}, Long: {position.coords.longitude}
      </div>
    )
  }

  if (status === 'rejected') {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Oh no, there was a problem getting your position:</div>

        <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
